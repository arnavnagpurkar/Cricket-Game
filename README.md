# Cricket-Game
Made a cricket game using Python

## Features:
- You have to select any random number from 1 to 6.
- The computer will also select a number.
- While batting, if the number selected by you and computer is different, then your number will add to your runs. If the number selected by you and computer is same, then you will lose your wicket.
- While bowling, if the number selected by you and computer is different, then the computer's number will add to its runs. If the number selected by you and computer is same, then the computer will lose its wicket.
- Each player will get 2 wickets and 2 overs (12 balls) for batting and bowling.
- The innings will end after either the two wickets fell or the overs end.
- The player with maximum runs wins.
